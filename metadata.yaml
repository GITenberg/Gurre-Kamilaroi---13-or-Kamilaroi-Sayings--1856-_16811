description: "gurre kamilaroi or Kamilaroi Sayings was a manual of Biblical instruction\
  \ for the Kamilaroi people in their own language, produced by William Ridley and\
  \ published in Sydney in 1856.\nRidley wanted to make sure that the text was easy\
  \ for those just learning to read. Majuscules were avoided, so that only one letter\
  \ shape would have to be learnt. He represented the sound of \"ng\" with a single\
  \ letter, ‹ŋ›, as it is a single sound. He insisted that the letters ‹g›, ‹h›, ‹r›,\
  \ ‹w›, and ‹y› be called ge (as in get), he, re, we and ye, so that they would correspond\
  \ better to the sound they represent.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
